Hi! My name is Jordan. I currently live in Kansas City (on the Missouri side). Currently, I attend [Hack Reactor]gs(www.hackreactor.com), a three-month coding bootcamp, after which I'll start looking for software engineering jobs in my area.

While I'm doing Hack Reactor, my two cats Julius and Franklin will keep me company. Or rather, they'll try to distract me. It's how they show love.
