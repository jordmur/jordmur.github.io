Hi! My name is Jordan. I currently live in Kansas City (on the Missouri side). At the beginning of January, I'm starting [Hack Reactor] (www.hackreactor.com), a three-month long coding bootcamp, after which I'll start looking for software engineering jobs in my area.

While I'm doing Hack Reactor, my two cats Julius and Franklin will keep me company. Or rather, they'll try to distract me. It's how they show love.
